    """
    CMPolicyManager is responsible for managing the policy configuration
    for the CryptoMesh system.

    This class provides methods to load and interpret policies defined
    in a YAML file. It serves as the central component for reading,
    parsing, and converting policy definitions into a structured Policy
    object that can be utilized throughout the system.

    Methods
    -------
    load_policy() -> Dict[str, Any]
        Loads the policy YAML file and returns a dictionary containing
        the policy configuration.

    interpret() -> Policy
        Interprets the loaded policy data and converts it into a Policy
        object.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize a new instance of CMPolicyManager.

        This constructor currently does not perform any heavy initialization.
        The policy is expected to be loaded and interpreted using the
        load_policy() and interpret() methods.

    def load_policy(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Load the policy configuration from a YAML file.

        This method reads the YAML file that contains the policy definitions,
        parses its contents, and returns the data as a dictionary. This
        configuration dictionary serves as the basis for the policy interpretation.

        Returns
        -------
        Dict[str, Any]
            A dictionary containing the policy configuration loaded from the YAML file.

        Raises
        ------
        FileNotFoundError
            If the policy YAML file is not found.
        YAMLError
            If there is an error parsing the YAML file.

        Interpret the loaded policy configuration and convert it into a Policy object.

        This method processes the dictionary obtained from load_policy(), validates
        the policy data, and translates the content into a structured Policy
        object. This Policy object encapsulates all the security rules, service
        definitions, and interactions as defined in the YAML file.

        Returns
        -------
        Policy
            A Policy object that represents the structured policy settings as
            defined in the YAML file.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the policy data is invalid or incomplete.
