Crypto Mesh is a platform engineered to build secure service meshes specifically tailored for machine learning applications. By leveraging advanced cryptographic protocols alongside a robust, distributed mesh architecture, it ensures that data exchanged between machine learning services remains confidential and tamper-proof.



## ‚ö†Ô∏è Clone the repo and setup a remoto üç¥: 

1. You must clone the remote from the organization of Muyal: 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:muyal-research-group/CryptoMesh.git
```

2. You must create a fork (please check it up in the [Contribution](#contribution) section)

3. Add a new remote in your local git: 
   ```bash
   git remote add <remote_name> <ssh> 
   ```
You must select ```<remote_name>``` and you must copy the ```<ssh>``` uri in the github page of your

</div>

4. Remember to push all your commits to your ```<remote_name>``` to avoid github conflicts. 

Thats it!  let's get started üöÄ

## Getting started

You must install the following software: 

- [Docker](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#linuxunix)
- Poetry
    ```bash
    pip3 install poetry
    ```
- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#linuxunix) (Optional)
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://pyenv.run | bash
    ```


Once you get all the software, please execute the following command to install the dependencies of the project: 

```bash
poetry install
```
### How to deploy database and broker

**Install docker and docker Compose:**

- Make sure Docker is installed on your system. See [Docker's installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for instructions.
- Docker Compose is usually included with Docker Desktop. Otherwise, follow [Docker Compose installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

**Navigate to your project directory:**

- Open a terminal and change to the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located.

**Start the services:**

- Run the following command to start both services in detached mode:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**Stopping the services:**
```bash
docker compose down
```


## Running the CryptoMesh Server with Poetry

Follow these steps to run the CryptoMesh server:

1. **Install Poetry (if not already installed):**
   - Follow the instructions at [Poetry Installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

2. **Install Project Dependencies(If not already installed):**
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory (where your `pyproject.toml` file is located).
   - Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
     ```bash
     poetry install
     ```

3. **Run the Server:**
   - Start the server using Poetry's virtual environment with this command:
     ```bash
     poetry run python3 ./cryptomesh/server.py
     ```
   - This ensures that the server runs with the correct dependencies specified in your project.

4. **Access the API Endpoints:**
   - Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints in your browser or via a tool like cURL/Postman:
     - `http://localhost:19000/api/v1/services`
     - `http://localhost:19000/api/v1/microservices`
     - `http://localhost:19000/api/v1/functions`

5. **Stopping the Server:**
   - To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

**Note:**  
Ensure that any other required services (like MongoDB) are running before starting the server.

## 2. Entity Relationships

- **Security Policy and Roles:**  
  The `SecurityPolicyModel` contains a list of role IDs (in the `roles` field). These IDs refer to entries in the `RoleModel`, allowing policies to group multiple roles.

- **Endpoints and Security Policy:**  
  Each `EndpointModel` holds a `security_policy` field that contains the `sp_id` of a security policy. This links endpoints with specific security rules and restrictions.

- **Services, Microservices, and Functions:**  
  - A `ServiceModel` groups its microservices via the `microservices` field (a list of microservice IDs).
  - A `MicroserviceModel` holds a list of functions (by their `function_id`), establishing a hierarchy where services contain microservices and microservices group functions.

- **Functions and Endpoints:**  
  Each `FunctionModel` includes an `endpoint_id` field that references the EndpointModel where it is deployed, creating a direct link between functions and their operational environment.

- **State and Results Tracking:**  
  - The `EndpointStateModel` logs the operational state of endpoints.
  - The `FunctionStateModel` tracks the execution state of functions in real time.
  - The `FunctionResultModel` stores the final outcomes of function executions and can be related back to the function‚Äôs state through the `state_id`.
